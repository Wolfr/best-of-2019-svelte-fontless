## Tech used

* I used the Svelte JS template as a base. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.
* For routing I used Routify: http://routify.now.sh/

## Running the project

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Compiling SCSS

Run

```bash
npm run-script css-dev
```

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
